# PyIU Crash Course

The Python Crash Courses aim to provide a functional introduction to Python designed for novice or new users of the programming language. Attendees learn about programming basics as well as the advantages and drawbacks of Python as a programming language, and why it has become so popular across STEM disciplines today. Instructors present live coding demo covering the fundamental components of Python using notebooks hosted on Google Colaboratory. 

Crash Course topics typically include:
- Variables
- Lists
- Loops (for/while)
- Logic (if/else statements)
- Functions
- Plotting
- Coding conventions & comments

## Get Coding

The materials from all in-person Crash Courses are uploaded in this public repository, and can be accessed freely. Slides are uploaded in .pptx format, with the session date indicated by the prefix (e.g., "F24" = Fall 2024). Each code demo is uploaded as a notebook file (".ipynb"), and has a corresponding completed version with the added suffix "_complete.ipynb". Try to follow the lessons in each notebook and finish the demo versions yourself first, and check your results against the complete versions!

Demos:
- **blackbody_demo.ipynb:** An applied introductory demo that walks students through the fundamentals of Python while creating blackbody emission models for stars. Culminates with plotting several blackbody models against actual stellar spectra, allowing students to also try their hand at astronomy by identifying the spectral type of a real star!
- **general_python_demo.ipynb:** A comprehensive introductory demo that covers all the basics and fundamental functionality of Python, including plotting.
