Completed versions of the crash course demos containing the in-session "solutions".

  
Demos:
- **hr_diagram_demo_complete.ipynb:** An applied introductory demo that covers the fundamental components of Python and several handy built-in functions while incrementally working toward creating a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram from real stellar cluster data.
- **blackbody_demo_complete.ipynb:** An applied introductory demo that walks students through the fundamentals of Python while creating blackbody emission models for stars. Culminates with plotting several blackbody models against actual stellar spectra, allowing students to also try their hand at astronomy by identifying the spectral type of a real star!
- **general_python_demo_complete.ipynb:** A comprehensive introductory demo that covers all the basics and fundamental functionality of Python, including plotting.
- **general_demo_exercises_complete.ipynb:** An introductory demo covering the basics of Python with built-in exercises to practice your skills.
