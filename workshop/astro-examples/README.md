# Astronomy Packages and Examples
- **astro_packages.ipynb:** Notebook with several examples using the `astropy` package, including reading in fits files, plotting images, and analyzing spectra.
- **hubblelaw_demo.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating how to reproduce and update the famous result from Hubble's 1929 paper reporting the expansion of the universe. Note that the "Real_Astro_Demo_Hubble.pptx" is a slideset that provides background for this demo, while the `cosmicflows3.tsv` file contains the modern data necessary to update the Hubble Law in the demo.
