# PyIU Advanced Workshops

The PyIU Advanced Workshops are designed to provide a flexible, laid-back, and interactive environment for students to learn practical and powerful Python skills from instructors with diverse expertise. From advanced plotting techniques to querying online databases, these topics will help attendees become better prepared for research in a variety of STEM fields. Instructors are also available to help with Python installation and any other general Python/programming questions, so no prior experience is necessary to attend. 

## Get Coding

All materials, including data, slides, and Python notebooks ("ipynb" files) from our in person Advanced Workshop sessions are organized by topic and posted in this public repository.

Topics that are covered include:
- Data Analysis (numpy, pandas, & more)
- Advanced Plotting
- Data Handling & Fitting
- Astronomy Packages & Examples
- Python Installation, Environments, & IDEs
- Numerical Integration & Simulations
- Statistics
- Python Fundamentals

The fastest and easiest way to get coding with these examples is through <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colaboratory</a>, though most should run with any `anaconda` installation of Python.
